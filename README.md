## Overview

Welcome to my **Unified Mentor Internship** report. Over the course of **one month**, I contributed to four projects—two minor and two major—that honed my skills in full-stack web development, API integration, and cloud services.

---

## Objectives

During this internship, I aimed to:

1. **Apply Theoretical Knowledge:** Transform concepts of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase into real-world applications.  
2. **Master API Integration:** Seamlessly fetch and display data from external services.  
3. **Build End-to-End Solutions:** Implement user authentication, database operations, and responsive UIs.  
4. **Adhere to Best Practices:** Write modular, maintainable code and follow version-control workflows.

**Technologies:** HTML · CSS · JavaScript  

**Description:** A sleek web calculator capable of handling all fundamental arithmetic operations.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Responsive UI:** Adaptive layout for desktops and mobile devices.  
- **Operator Precedence:** Handles BODMAS/BIDMAS rules correctly.  
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully manages division by zero and invalid inputs.

1. **HTML Structure:** Organized display and keypad sections with semantic tags.  
2. **CSS Styling:** Flexbox-based layout, intuitive button states, and smooth hover effects.  
3. **JavaScript Logic:**  
   - Input parsing and expression validation.  
   - Safe evaluation using `try…catch` blocks.  
   - Keyboard support for improved UX.  

**Learnings:** Mastered DOM manipulation, event listeners, and robust input validation.

### 2. Weather App

**Technologies:** HTML · CSS · JavaScript · OpenWeatherMap API  

**Description:** Fetches real-time weather data for any user-entered city and displays it with contextually relevant icons.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Asynchronous Fetch:** Utilized `async/await` for clean API calls.  
- **Dynamic UI Updates:** Instant feedback on search results or errors.  
- **Mobile-First Design:** Ensures readability on all screen sizes.

1. **API Integration:**  
   - Secured API key in a separate config file.  
   - Parsed JSON for temperature, description, and icon assets.  
2. **Error Management:** Differentiated between network failures and invalid city queries.  
3. **User Feedback:** Custom messages and fallback UI for robustness.

**Learnings:** Gained hands-on experience with external APIs, asynchronous JavaScript patterns, and UX-focused error handling.
